function [ broadcastCentrality, receiveCentrality ] = ...
    broadcastRecieveCentrality( contactSequence,alpha, nNodes, nTimes )
%% Calculate the broadcast and receive centrality as defined in Mantzaris
% et al. 2013.
%
% Inputs:
%       contactSequence = nEdges x 3 array of (i,j,t) tuples indicating
%           contact between nodes i,j at time t. Assumes undirected.
%       alpha = scalar in (0,1) governing weight given to paths based on
%           the number of edges.
%
% Optional Inputs:
%       nNodes = number of nodes in the dynamic network. Default is all
%           nodes which appear in contactSequence (have at least one
%           contact).
%
% Outputs:
%       broadcastCentrality = nNodes x 1 vector recording the broadcast
%           centrality at each node.
%       receiveCentrality = nNodes x 1 vector recording the receive
%           centrality at each node.
